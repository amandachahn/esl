I volunteer as an adult literacy instructor in Los Angeles, CA. As I created new material, I realized I would love to share what I've made. I have learned so much from ESL instrcutors who have done the same. I thought I'd pay it forward!

### My approach
My goal is for learners to get as much practice speaking English in a way that replicates real world scenarios. In my class, learners participate in different role-playing exercises intended to mimic conversations they may have in the real world. My approach and teaching is heavily inspired by my experience as an improv comedian and teacher. We role play scenarios like: being seated at a restaurant, signing in at a doctors office, getting into large events, and more. They seem to love it! They say this approach is useful, and they have expressed they have new confidence to try the things we've practiced. Nothing makes me happier! I want every learner to walk away more knowledgable and confident to try whatever activies they've been hestitant to do because of a language barrier.
