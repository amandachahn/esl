I'm very excited to begin sharing resources and lesson plans I've used for adult learners learning English.

This is still very young, and I'm still building all of this out. My dream is for this to be as useful as a resource for others as the ESL tutoring community has been for my work.

I currently have a backlog of past classes I'm catching up on, but from this point forward, my plan is to post updates on each class's topic, tools, and structures for that day. I'll get to the backlog eventually!

Please see my [About page](https://amandachahn.github.io/esl/about) to learn more about my background and approach.

I would also love to hear from you all! Please use this site's corresponding [discussion board](https://github.com/amandachahn/esl/discussions) to share feedback, ask questions, or just say hi to connect!

Can't wait to be in touch.

Amanda
