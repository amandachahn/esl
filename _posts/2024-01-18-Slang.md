## Today's format

### 1. Word sorting worksheet

[Worksheet: Describing people with slang](/assets/slang/Word%20Sorting%20-%20Describing%20People%20-%20Slang.odt)

### 2. Scenes - with slang!

#### Prep

I took all the words that appeared in [In the Loop](https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/in_the_loop_pages.pdf).
I saved them to a [csv file](/assets/slang/idioms_from_intheloop.csv).
I loaded that into R and created a script to randomly select idioms from the full list: [idiom_load.R](/process/idiom_load.R)

#### In class

Two person scenes
- Get suggestions of locations, people's relationship to each other, and what they are doing.
- Run [idiom_load.R](/process/idiom_load.R) to randomly select idioms. Those idioms must be said during the scene! 
- Rinse, repeat, and have fun!
