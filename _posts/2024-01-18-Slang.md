## Today's format

### 1. Word sorting worksheet

- assets\slang\Word Sorting - Describing People - Slang.odt

### 2. Scenes - with slang!

#### Prep
See process\idiom_load.R.
I took all the words that appeared in [In the Loop](https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/in_the_loop_pages.pdf).
I saved them to a csv file.
I loaded that into R and created a script to randomly select idioms from the full list.

#### In class

Two person scenes
- Get suggestions of locations, people's relationship to each other, and what they are doing.
- Run idiom_load.R to randomly select idioms. Those idioms must be said during the scene! 
- Rinse, repeat, and have fun!
